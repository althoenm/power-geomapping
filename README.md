# power-geomapping

This notebook was custom built to map out active projects in the SE Michigan area for a local home remodelling business. A list of addresses were taken in and geomapped  using the Folium library to showcase location of active projects along with relevant details. 

The map produced is interactive and saved as an HTML file to be opened in browser of choice.
